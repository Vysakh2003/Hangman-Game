# Hangman-Game

The "Hangman" game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a secret word within a limited number of attempts. The game's main objective is to provide entertainment and mental stimulation by engaging players in word recognition and deduction.

Here's a short note on how the "Hangman" game works:
    
  -✔️ Word Selection: At the start of the game, a secret word is randomly selected from a predefined list of words. This list may contain various words, ranging from common nouns to more challenging vocabulary.

  -✔️ Displaying the Word: The secret word is initially hidden from the player, and its length is represented by a sequence of asterisks. Each asterisk corresponds to an unknown letter in the word. This representation conceals the word and challenges the player to uncover it by guessing individual letters.

  -✔️ Number of Attempts: The player is allotted a specific number of attempts, typically based on the number of unique characters in the secret word. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of remaining attempts.

  -✔️ Guessing Letters: The player is prompted to input a letter as their guess. The game validates the input to ensure that it is a single letter and has not been guessed before. If the input is valid, the game proceeds to check if the letter is present in the secret word.

  -✔️ Correct Guesses: If the guessed letter is present in the secret word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in the word display. The player can use this information to make subsequent guesses more effectively.

  -✔️ Incorrect Guesses: If the guessed letter is not part of the secret word, the game informs the player of the incorrect guess and reduces the remaining attempts.

  -✔️ Victory Condition: The player wins the game if they successfully guess all the letters of the secret word within the given attempts. The full word is revealed, and the game congratulates the player on their victory.

  -✔️ Defeat Condition: The player loses the game if they exhaust all the allowed attempts without guessing the complete word. In this case, the game displays a message of encouragement and invites the player to try again.

  -✔️ End of Game: The game concludes with a message indicating the end of the "Hangman" game. Players can choose to play again with a new word or exit the game.
